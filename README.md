Above, in this project, I configure the "Roles", "Departments" and "Teams" sections in the Admin Panel of osTicket. In order to do this, I begin in the "Roles" section, which is to allow grouping permissions, by going to "Admin Panel", choosing "Agents", then "Roles". In this project, I use the Main Admin as the role.
Next, I go back to the Admin Panel and to the "Departments" tab. I fill out all the necessary fields and use "SysAdmins" in this project for the department. Lastly, in the "Teams" tab, I fill out the necessary fields and use "Refund Requests" in the project and create the team.

In the final step, I go to the Admin Panel. I then begin configuring each section in their appropriate location. I then go to Admin Panel, choose Agents then go to the following: Roles, Departments, Teams, User Settings then allow all users to create tickets, Agents (workers), SLA and then Help Topics.
